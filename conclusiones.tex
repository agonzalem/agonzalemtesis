%In this work, a basic solution, BSGR, to simulate pore networks under the existence of Geometrical Restrictions was proposed. This approach is a contribution in the study of more realistic pore materials. In order to offer an efficient solution, we also proposed a parallel version of BSGR. The parallel algorithm was designed by using a set of threads which cooperate in the construction of the pore network. A dynamic data partitioning was performed among the executing threads. Our results indicated that the proposed parallel algorithm outperformed its sequential counterpart, for example in a configuration with $L= 100$, $\Omega=0.13$ and using $16$ threads the acceleration obtained was $20.6$ times faster. Future work includes the design and comparison of different versions of our parallel solution using different architectures like clusters, multi-core processors and GPU's.
